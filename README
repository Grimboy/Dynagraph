Dynagraph (orginally from: http://www.dynagraph.org/)
(But this one builds with newer versions of Graphviz)

Requirements:
graphviz
boost_thread
flex & bison
probably some other stuff

To build on Linux:
If you're not on a 64 bit system edit Config.mk to set ARCH=linux.i386
$ ./configure.old
$ make

TODO:
Maybe clean things up a little bit.
